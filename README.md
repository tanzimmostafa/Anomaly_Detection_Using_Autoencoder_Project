# Anomaly_Detection_Using_Autoencoder_Project

This project is part of my midterm for the course CS6699: "Advanced AI", at Idaho State University.

The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate an autoencoder for the purpose of anomaly detection on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, available in Kaggle. 

## Context:
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is **highly unbalanced**, the **positive class (frauds) account for 0.172%** of all transactions.

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
