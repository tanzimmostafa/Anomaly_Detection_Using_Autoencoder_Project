# Anomaly_Detection_Using_Autoencoder_Project

This project is part of my midterm for the course CS6699: "Advanced AI", where I utilize an autoencoder as an anomaly detector for Credit Card Fraud Detection. 

The Credit Card Fraud Detection can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
